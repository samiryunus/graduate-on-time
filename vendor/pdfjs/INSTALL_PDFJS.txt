OFFLINE PDF PARSING — INSTALL OFFICIAL PDF.JS FILES

This site expects these files to exist:

  vendor/pdfjs/pdf.min.js
  vendor/pdfjs/pdf.worker.min.js

How to get them (official build):
1) On a machine with internet, download the PDF.js "generic" build (or pdfjs-dist legacy build).
   Recommended source: the official mozilla/pdf.js project or the npm package "pdfjs-dist".

2) Copy the two minified files into this folder with EXACT names:
   - pdf.min.js
   - pdf.worker.min.js

3) Run the site via a local server:
   python -m http.server 8000
   then open http://localhost:8000

Notes:
- If your PDF is scanned (image-only), text extraction may be empty. In that case, manually enter courses.
- This tool is for planning; verify prerequisites, offerings, and transfer equivalencies with your department.
